Elevator Management System Simulation

Overview

This application simulates the behavior of an elevator management system for a multi-floor building. It ensures efficient handling of elevator requests, optimizing for speed, load balance, and direction. The system dynamically assigns the most suitable elevator based on the current state and usage patterns, while also providing fallback mechanisms for edge cases.

Key Features

    Dynamic Elevator Assignment: Selects the best elevator based on direction, distance, load capacity, and idle status.
    Fallback Mechanisms: Includes secondary selection criteria to handle scenarios where no immediately optimal elevator is available.
    Time Estimation Algorithm: Simulates elevator movement and provides an accurate estimation of time to reach the target floor.
    Queue Management: Dynamically updates request queues to simulate real-time elevator behavior.
    Fail-Safe Mechanisms: Ensures elevators marked as "Out of Service" are excluded from assignments.

Application Flow

Request Creation: A user inputs a request specifying the current floor, target floor, and direction.
Primary Elevator Selection: The system evaluates elevators based on:

    Status (idle, moving in the same direction, or moving in the opposite direction)
    Proximity to the requesting floor
    Current load and capacity

Secondary Elevator Selection: If no elevator meets the primary criteria, the system considers elevators that can service the request after completing their current tasks.
Final Fallback: If no suitable elevator is found, the system assigns the least busy elevator.
Time Simulation: The EstimateTimeToReach method calculates the time for an elevator to reach the requesting floor, considering:
Travel time between floors
Door operation and loading/unloading delays

Core Implementations

    Elevator Request Handling

      Evaluates all available elevators and prioritizes based on:
      Direction alignment with the request
      Distance from the requesting floor
      Load capacity and availability

Time Estimation

Simulates the elevator's queue to estimate the time needed to fulfill a request.

    Factors in:
    
        Travel time between floors
        Loading/unloading time for passengers
        Door operation delays


Queue Management
Dynamically updates the elevator's request queue for real-time behavior simulation.
Ensures accurate time estimation without mutating the original queue.

Code Highlights

    Dynamic Queue Simulation

        var simulatedQueue = new Queue<int>(elevator.RequestQueue); // Deep copy
        simulatedQueue.Enqueue(request.FromFloor);
        simulatedQueue.Enqueue(request.ToFloor);

    Fallback Mechanism

        if (!eligibleElevators.Any())
        {
            eligibleElevators = elevators
                .Where(e => e.Status != ElevatorStatus.OutOfService)
                .OrderBy(e => EstimateTimeToReach(e, request.FromFloor, request))
                .ToList();
        }

    Time Estimation

        int time += Math.Abs(currentFloor - nextStop); // Travel time
        time += 5; // Door operation time
        if (currentFloor == request.FromFloor || currentFloor == request.ToFloor)
            time += 2 * request.PeopleCount; // Loading/unloading

Future Improvements

      Implement machine learning to predict elevator demand patterns.
      Add support for real-time monitoring and visualization.
      Integrate with IoT devices for smarter elevator control.
      Enhance fault-tolerance mechanisms.
